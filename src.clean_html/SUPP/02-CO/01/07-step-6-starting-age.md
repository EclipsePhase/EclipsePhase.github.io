# 6 Starting Age

<!-- CLEANED div class="no-margin" -->
<!-- CLEANED blockquote class="header-bg" -->

**Roll on the 6.0 Age table to determine your character’s rough age at the beginning of play (for example, in your 20s, 30s, 40s, etc.). To determine an exact age, just roll a d10 for the second digit. For example, if you roll a 23, your character is in their 30s. A d10 roll of 5 to determine exact age would mean the character is 35 at the start of play. Exceptionally young characters skip Step 7 and go directly to the events of the Fall (Step 8).**

**INFOLIFE/LOST/UPLIFT BACKGROUNDS:**

If you acquired the Infolife background in Step 4, your character is in their 20s. Skip directly to Step 8.

If you acquired the Lost background, your character is 9 years old, though you have experienced a subjective 20 + 1d6 years of combined virtual and real-world life. Skip directly to Step 9.

If you acquired the Uplift background, your character’s age may not exceed 50. Re-roll higher results.
