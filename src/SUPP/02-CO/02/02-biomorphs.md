# Biomorphs

### Alpiner

Alpiners were common in the early days of the Martian frontier, when temperatures and atmospheric pressure had not yet risen to present levels. Now they are favored by avid rock climbers, those living at high altitudes atop Mars’s shield volcanoes, and outdoor types who must endure more harsh and rugged conditions. Alpiners are also vogue among chic urbanites going for a rough-and-ready look without sleeving the more de classe ruster morph.

### Aquanaut

Aquanauts are environmentally adapted for underwater activities while still functional on land. Their heart rate slows while submerged, their skin includes a layer of blubber that retains heat, they store oxygen in their muscle tissue, and they do not suffer negative health effects from pressure changes. Additionally, their eyes have nictitating membranes and their corneas adjust to counter underwater refraction. Their hands and feet are webbed and they possess a transgenic swim bladder for controlling buoyancy. They can safely descend to about 200 meters depth (roughly 21 atmospheres of pressure at 1 g); deeper requires the pressure adaptation mod.

### Ariel

The surprising number of transhumans who sleeve in Titan-adapted hulder morphs encouraged designers on Profunda to develop a Titan-adapted flyer. While the sturdy hulder morph is designed for nomadic herders, the ariel morph is designed by people who wish to survive by hunting. Individuals sleeved in the ariel morph can hunt and eat Titanian caribou, but they most often eat the smaller rabbitlike creatures that Profunda designers have also recently designed to live on Titan. Ariel morphs have exotic-looking heads similar to those of hulder morphs, but they also possess sleek and streamlined humanoid bodies with four limbs and a pair of bat-like wings. These morphs have also been used by a few daring transhumans to explore the upper cloud layers of both Saturn and Uranus.

### Cloud Skate

Cloud skates are exotic, specialized biomorph designs that push the edge of what is possible. They are designed to survive in the atmospheres of ice giants and gas giants, such as Uranus and Jupiter. These morphs are shaped roughly like a tailless stingray with a pair of slender arms. They can soar among the clouds for months on end, their swim bladders providing neutral buoyancy in dense atmospheres, preventing them from sinking below a safe depth.

### Faust

Developed in secret by a small group of unaffiliated async genehackers, this morph is not a publicly known model. It is only available to individuals who discover a connection to this unnamed, underground async network and then download the template from one of several secret mesh sites. The faust is a modified menton morph. Even under the most thorough scans, it appears to be nothing more than a mildly personalized version of that morph.

### Freeman

This sleeve hands tyrants the tools to ensure loyalty — or at least obedience — from their citizens. Based on simple splicers, freeman morphs are genetically and psychosurgically modified to be receptive to authority while weakening willpower and “dissident” traits. They are also genetically modified with a protein that makes their neurons sensitive to light. When combined with an optogenetics module, these neurons can be activated and deactivated remotely, enabling a monitoring muse or meshed overseer to control the ego’s behavior. Freeman morphs typically carry a monitor ALI (often a modified fork of the dictator’s muse) that watches over the ego, reports suspicious activity, and can seize physical control in an emergency. In some regimes, citizens are not informed of these implants, enabling the AIs to spy and snitch in secret. These “slave morphs” are decried or outlawed as coercive in many polities, though they are secretly deployed in remote corporate and authoritarian habitats. Surprisingly, some people voluntarily sleeve freeman morphs, preferring to hand responsibility and decision-making over to other parties, such as the Sendero Luminoso Benevolent Dictatorship habitat in the Neptunian Trojans.

### Futura

Futura morphs were specially crafted for the “Lost Generation” of accelerated-growth children. Adjusted for confidence, self-reliance, and adaptability, futuras were intended to help transhumanity regain its foothold.

### Imp

Shortly after the Fall, the refugees from Earth who would evolve into the scum faction struggled for resources under cramped conditions. Partying and letting off steam became an essential element of their survival. To complement this lifestyle, scum genehackers crafted morphs with the endurance to handle ragers with copious amounts of sex and drugs. These models became popular across the Solar System, particularly with “party tourists” looking to egocast into a new habitat, go on a week-long bender, and then beam back out.

Bio-engineered to survive in the semi-protected vacuum of coronal habitats, salamanders are popular with Solarians who need to adopt a humanoid form. Their skin is thick and hairless, their eyes reflective, with an overall look that is part reptilian, part monkey, and part fey. They lack noses and mouths, communicating wirelessly or via chromatophore patterning.

### Selkie

Selkies are similar to aquanauts with heavy splices of seal traits. Their legs are fused into a pair of hind flippers for powerful swimming. On land, they can stand but have difficulty moving, as they must flop, roll, or hop like a seal, but they are sometimes sleeved in micrograv habs. They are adapted for the lack of air, deep cold, and crushing pressure of subcrustal oceans.

### Surya

Despite the extreme temperatures of the solar corona, the plasma in that part of the sun’s atmosphere is incredibly diffuse, meaning actual heat transfer is quite low, making it survivable with the right protections. Suryas blur the line between biomorph and synthmorph and push the envelope of synthetic biology in order to survive in this hostile environment. Named for a Hindu sun deity, suryas reach lengths of ten meters or more and rely heavily on both whale and extremophile genetics. Their skin is a metamaterial that provides an almost perfect reflection of the sun’s spectral output and enables radiative cooling. They “surf ” the solar winds using powerful magnetic fields that also shield from radiation, plasma, and heat. Strong bones and connective tissues protect against the crushing solar gravity while medichines repair tissue damaged by radiation and convert hydrogen ions into water. Surya rely on lasers and chromatophore signaling using wavelengths not flooded by the sun’s emissions to communicate.

A lateral line organ allows them to “hear” the low-frequency vibrations that resonate through the corona’s plasma, which is both useful for limited “whale song” short-range communication and helpful for predicting and avoiding flares and other solar weather.
