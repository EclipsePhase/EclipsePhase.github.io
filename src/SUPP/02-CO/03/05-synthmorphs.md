# Synthmorphs

## Arachnoid

Arachnoid shells mimic the shapes of spiders, termites, ants, beetles, and other arthropods. Three or four sets of pneumatic limbs are capable of rotating around their meter-long torso, and an additional set of manipulator arms near the head enables fine manipulation and tool use. Arachnoids move by walking, hopping, extending omnidirectional mini-wheels for skating movement, or by retracting their limbs and maneuvering with vectored-air thrusters in microgravity.

## Biocore

The biocore is a synthmorph with a biological brain. This design is favored by those who wish to enjoy the advantages of sleeving in a synthmorph without the risk of brainhacking or who simply dislike the idea of using a cyberbrain. It is popular with asyncs, as they retain their psi abilities. Some models feature a stylized but transparent braincase, to show off the biocore’s main feature, but others appear to be ordinary synthmorphs from the outside; only a detailed physical examination can determine that it actually contains a living brain.

## Courier

Couriers were made to soar between the many moons and habitats in the Saturnian system. They are shaped like a multi-armed chess piece, with a humanoid head and torso atop a conical metallic-hydrogen rocket. With an acceleration of up to 0.25 g, couriers can take off and land on all moons and other small bodies in the Solar System (though entering an atmosphere such as Titan’s requires heat shielding). Since propellant storage is limited, an integrated plasma sail provides alternative thrust.

## Griefer

Griefers are disposable morphs used by trolls, vandals, and terrorists to spread chaos, harass people, antagonize the authorities, and worse. Griefers have embedded sound and holographic display systems to make their presence known. They are often equipped with hacking tools and other subversive ware, from graffiti implements and mounted sprayers to nanoswarm hives or even explosives, according to their specific purpose. Most importantly, they are built without cortical stacks, so if they are destroyed, the ego cannot be interrogated through psychosurgery. Griefers are illegal in many habitats, especially in the Planetary Consortium, but DRM-free blueprints are easy to find in many darknets, thus making them a persistent annoyance across the Solar System. in some systems. A few habitats have passed laws mandating that destroying a griefer is not considered murder, assault, or even destruction of property.

## Oobleck

Also known as gloops, ooblecks are shapechanging morphs consisting of reconfigurable components in a shear-thickening liquid matrix with a soft, flexible outer skin. Though they often take on a blob-like, amorphous state, they can transform themselves into all manner of shapes, including consolidating into more rigid forms. They can ooze through openings as small as 10 centimeters in diameter. Though their shape-changing options are more limited than flexbots, they can transform more quickly.

## Q-Morph

Quartz morphs, commonly called Q-morphs, are the primary shell design used for Venusian surface mining. Constructed from quartz and extremely durable alloys, Q-morphs look like squat, four-legged crabs with two pairs of arms. The lower pair of arms is designed for strength, the upper pair for precision and dexterity. This morph is exceptionally tough and capable of handling Venus’s intense surface conditions. Behavioral mods help keep the workers sleeved in these morphs content with their grueling existence.

## Reaper

The reaper is a combat morph in the form of an armored disc, so that it can turn and present a thin profile to an enemy. Four legs/manipulating arms and four weapon pods are folded inside its frame. It uses vector-thrust nozzles to maneuver in microgravity and also takes advantage of an ionic drive for fast movement over distance. Reapers are infamous due to military sims and Fall XPs; bringing one into most habitats will undoubtedly raise eyebrows if not get you arrested.

## Rover

Rover morphs are smaller, defense-oriented rollers loosely based on sphere morph designs. Each rover is 0.6 meters in diameter and, with its limbs retracted, has the ominous appearance of a reflective, shiny, black globe. It can extrude two manipulating arms and 2 other articulating weapon mounts equipped with a pistol and an agonizer on default models. Rovers are stealthy and highly maneuverable and so favored for bodyguard and police purposes in some areas. They are often deployed via remote control.

## Swarmanoid

Swarmanoids are swarms composed of hundreds of insect-sized microbots. Each individual “bug” is capable of crawling, rolling, hopping several meters, or using nanocopter fan blades for airlift. The cyberbrain, cortical stack, and sensor systems are distributed throughout the swarm. Though the swarm can “meld” together into various loose shapes, it is incapable of physical tasks like grabbing, lifting, or holding. Individual bots are linked by radio and laser and are quite capable of interfacing with electronics.

## Synth

Synths are even more humanoid than cases and of better quality. They are commonly deployed for labor-intensive tasks in environments not suited for biomorphs or for people who need a body quickly and cheaply or simply on a transient basis.

## Xu Fu

Named after a historical Chinese explorer, many gatecrashers consider xu fus the ideal exoplanet exploration synthmorph. Its main body sits atop 6 legs that end in multidirectional smart wheels for quick travel, capable of rolling in any direction and over rough terrain. For exceptionally difficult terrain, the wheels can be retracted and the xu fu can maneuver as a walker. In addition to two standard arms, it features a lower third arm for collecting samples and an upper telescoping fourth arm for reaching far distances and overseeing obstacles. All arms are retractable. Xu fus have an impressive sensor package and are ideal for surface-based scouting, investigating tunnels, and other gatecrashing tasks.
